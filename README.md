# Advent-2019

This year I am going to give the Advent of Code challenge a shot.

Hopefully I do well and complete several days in the challenge.

Day 3 I did not understand how to do or even where to start.
My plan for days I dont understand or do not do I will watch a tutorial after the event is over to get a better understanding.

After looking at a couple more days I need to do some major refactoring to what I have.  I have been getting back into my project I am working on and will come back to Advent of Code soon.

I also want to do go back and do previous years, so that could also result in file restucturing.
